# Advent Of Code Solutions
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) Solutions, done using Javascript. Written to be run by Nodejs.

### What I learned
- `Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER` can be used as a starting point for finding maximum of a set, instead of `-Infinity`.
- `Array.fill` passes the objects with reference.
    - See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35578478/array-prototype-fill-with-object-passes-reference-and-not-new-instance
- Number has a convenient `EPSILON` property.

### Influences
- I had to skim through solutions of others once, in Day 7, Part 2, 2019. While doing so, I found the following repo really useful: https://github.com/romellem/advent-of-code.
- [Brian Bucklew](https://twitter.com/unormal) was the one that suggests me to check this website out. He also nudged me to the correct direction more than once.
